#  Borderlands 2: What are the particular chances for the slot machine?

There are a variety of conflicting reports on the web about what are the particular chances for the slot machine in Borderlands 2. A few state that it is practically impossible to get the jackpot, while some others vow that it's very easy. So, what is the fact?

To begin with, it is important to understand that there are different versions of the slot machine in Borderlands 2. The ones located in Moxxi's bar are known as True Vault Hunter Mode machines and offer better payouts than the ones in Marcus' store. However, this doesn't mean that they're straightforward to win.

The probabilities of hitting certain combinations on the slot machine are as follows:

3 cherries - 1 in 10

3 lemons - 1 in 36

3 oranges - 1 in 144

3 plums - 1 in 576

3 bells - 1 in 3,584


Now, let's take a look at what you can win with these combinations. For example, if you hit three cherries you'll get 5 tokens, three lemons will give you 10 tokens, three oranges will award you 25 tokens and so on. But what about if you hit a jackpot? Well, unfortunately the odds of doing so aren't great - just 1 in 10,000. So, your best bet is to aim for smaller wins and hope for the best!

#  Borderlands 2: The Mysterious Slot Machine

Borderlands 2 did not appear to be much of an upgrade over the original game when it was first announced. The graphical fidelity had improved, but at its heart it was still a loot shooter reliant on grinding for new gear. However, Borderlands 2 delivered on all fronts and is now one of the most beloved games in the series.

One of the most exciting new features of Borderlands 2 was the addition of slot machines. These machines would give players the chance to win rare and powerful items, adding another layer of excitement to the game. But what are these machines, and where do they come from?

The slot machines in Borderlands 2 are not randomly generated generics like most other objects in the game. Instead, they are specific machines that are found in predetermined locations. There are three different types of slot machines: white, blue, and red. Each type has its own unique set of prizes.

White slot machines can be found in Freeside and The Strip. They offer modest rewards like weapon mods, shields, and grenades. Blue slot machines can be found in The Tundra Express and offer better rewards like rare weapons and armor pieces. Red slot machines can only be found in The Devil's Throat, and offer the best rewards including legendary weapons and class mods.

So why were these specific machines placed in these specific locations? One popular theory is that they were put there by Gearbox as a way to entice players into exploring every corner of the game world. And for the most part, this theory holds up. The only exception is The Devil's Throat, which seems to have been added purely for the sake of adding more challenge to the game.

#  Borderlands 2: What are the odds of winning with the slot machine?

If you are a fan of the Borderlands video game series, then you will want to try your luck at the slot machines in Borderlands 2. The odds of winning with the slot machine in Borderlands 2 are not very good, but there is still a chance that you could walk away a winner.

There are three different types of slot machines in Borderlands 2: The Bandit, The Sheriff and The Saint. The Bandit slot machine has the best odds of winning, while the Sheriff and Saint slot machines have the worst odds.

The Bandit slot machine has a payout percentage of 97.5%, which means that you will lose 2.5% of all the money that you bet on the machine. This may not seem like great odds, but it is still better than the payout percentage of the other two machines, which is only 75%.

So, if you are looking for a chance to win some money, then it is best to stick to playing at the Bandit slot machine. However, even with this machine, your chances of winning are still slim.

If you're looking to make some extra cash in Borderlands 2, one of the best ways to do so is by playing the slot machines. However, if you're not familiar with how they work or how to win at them, it can be tough to make any money.

In this article, we'll take a look at how the slot machines work in Borderlands 2 and give you some tips on how to win at them.

How Slot Machines Work in Borderlands 2

Slot machines in Borderlands 2 work a bit differently than they do in other video games. Instead of just spinning reels and hoping for the best, you actually have to play a mini-game in order to win rewards.

There are three different slot machine mini-games: A single spin game, a accelerated spin game, and a marathon spin game. The goal of each game is different, but the basic premise is the same - match symbols on the reels in order to win rewards.

The symbols on the reels will correspond to different items that you can win from the slot machine. In general, the better the symbol match, the better the reward you will receive. There are also rare "wild" symbols that can appear on the reels which can be used to match any other symbol and win a prize.

- First and foremost, always aim to match as many symbols as possible. The more symbols you match, the better your rewards will be.




- Look for wild symbols when possible and try to use them to create as many winning combinations as possible.




- Be patient! It may take some time to get used to the mini-games, but eventually you'll start winning more rewards.

#  Borderlands 2: Slot machine tips and tricks

Borderlands 2 is a first-person shooter with role-playing elements that was developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K Games. The game was released for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Microsoft Windows platforms in September 2012. Borderlands 2 is the sequel to 2009's Borderlands and its expansion pack, The Secret Armory of General Knoxx.

Borderlands 2 features four new playable characters: Axton the Commando, Zer0 the Assassin, Maya the Siren, and Salvador the Gunzerker. Players create characters through one of four classesâ€”Vault Hunter, Soldier, Berserker, or Siren. Each class has a unique skill tree that offers three different special abilities which can be upgraded as players progress throughout the game. New gameplay elements include a reveal mechanic that allows players to expose enemies hidden behind objects with a simple gesture; an addition to the game's inventory system called "Gun lust" which rewards players for stockpiling firearms; and an increased focus on vehicles that allows players to explore the open world map of Pandora to discover new areas not yet accessible on foot.

One way to get ahead in Borderlands 2 is to use the game's slot machines to your advantage. There are three different types of slot machines in Borderlands 2: red weapons slots, blue shields slots, and purple grenade mods slots. While there is no overarching strategy for how best to use them, there are some tips and tricks that you can employ to get ahead in the game using these machines:

1) Save your eridium bars: Don't waste your eridium bars on trying to get a legendary weapon from one of the slot machines early on in the game. Save them up until you reach level 50 so that you can get a better chance of winning a legendary weapon from one of the later slot machines.

2) Invest in shield slots: Shield slots are more important than weapon slots because they offer more protection against enemy fire. When trying to decide whether or not to invest in a particular slot machine, always go for shield slots over weapon slots.

3) Play the slot machines at higher levels: The better your character is levelled up, the better your chances are of winning big when playing at one of the slot machines. So if you're looking for an edge over your opponents, make sure to raise your character's level as high as possible before venturing into casinos seeking Slot machine glory!
