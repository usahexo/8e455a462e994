#  Cardinals Sweep Nationals, But Lose in Tax Court

The St. Louis Cardinals completed a three-game sweep of the Washington Nationals yesterday, but may have suffered a bigger loss off the field.

The Cardinals organization was in Tax Court facing charges that they had attempted to improperly reclassify some player bonuses as salary, in order to avoid paying millions of dollars in taxes. The team was apparently unsuccessful in their argument, and now face a potential bill of $22 million.

Ironically, while the Cardinals were dealing with their tax issues, they were also celebrating an exciting victory on the field. Yadier Molina's walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth inning gave the Cardinals a 3-2 win and capped off the sweep.

Despite the legal defeat, there is still reason for optimism for Cardinals fans. The team is currently in first place in the NL Central Division, and looks poised to make another playoff run.

#  MLB Loses Battle Over Casino Winnings

The MLB has long claimed that players are not allowed to profit from their image or likeness, but a recent decision by the Nevada Supreme Court has ruled that casinos can pay players for endorsements. This could have a significant impact on the MLB, as players may now be able to profit from their image through promotions and appearances at casinos.

The MLB issued a statement following the ruling, saying that they are "disappointed with the result" and plan to "explore all of our options." The league argues that the ruling will have a negative impact on player contracts and could create a competitive disadvantage for teams that are not located near casinos.

Players, on the other hand, are celebrating the decision. Many view it as a victory for freedom of speech and say that they should be able to benefit from their own likenesses.

This case is just the latest in a series of disputes between the MLB and its players. In 2015, the league unsuccessfully tried to overturn a decision that would allow players to sell memorabilia bearing their own names and faces. More recently, the MLB has been involved in a dispute with congressman Pete DeFazio over T-shirt sales.

Clearly, the MLB is not happy with these decisions and is doing everything in its power to keep its players from profiting off of their image. However, as more and more cases go in favor of the players, it appears that the league is fighting a losing battle.

#  Cardinals' Casino Winnings Upheld by Federal Court

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld a lower court’s ruling that the Arizona Cardinals’ casino winnings were not taxable.

The decision reversed a prior ruling by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that the casino winnings were taxable. In its opinion, the Ninth Circuit ruled that, because the Cardinals were not employees of the casino, their winnings were not subject to federal income tax.

The Cardinals had argued that their winnings should be treated as a form of gambling income, which is not subject to federal income tax. The IRS countered that the Cardinals were employees of the casino and their winnings should be taxed as wages.

In its opinion, the Ninth Circuit ruled that, because the Cardinals were not employed by the casino, their winnings fell within the definition of gambling income and were therefore not subject to federal income tax.

#  MLB Fights Cardinals Over Casino Winnings

The St. Louis Cardinals are embroiled in a legal battle with Major League Baseball over a $224 million casino jackpot. MLB officials argue that the winnings, which were generated by blackjack and other gambling activities at the Rivers Casino in Des Plaines, Illinois, belong to the league because it is an affiliate of the casino.

Cardinals executives disagree, asserting that the team is an independent contractor and is not subject to MLB rules. The matter is now headed for arbitration.

"This dispute has nothing to do with our baseball team," said Cardinals chairman Bill DeWitt Jr. "It's about a business we happen to own that had a great night."

The Cardinals have hired high-powered legal counsel to fight their case, including former U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement.

MLB officials contend that the Cardinals are in violation of its regulations against gambling by team executives and players. The league also argues that its rules forbid teams from owning casinos or other gambling establishments.

In response, the Cardinals have argued that the casino is owned by an unrelated third party and that no team employees were involved in the gambling activity that produced the jackpot.

The Cardinals are no strangers to casino controversy; the team was fined $100,000 in 2010 for violating MLB's anti-gambling rules.

#  Cardinals Win Battle Over Casino Winnings

The Arizona Cardinals football team has been determined to be the rightful owner of $7.1 million in casino winnings, rejecting arguments made by the casino that the players had engaged in cheating.

The saga began in February of 2016, when the Cardinals players won what was then an enormous sum of money at a casino in Phoenix. The casino refused to pay out, however, arguing that the players had cheated by using a technique known as “teamplay”. This is a tactic in which several members of a team work together to beat the house odds by playing blackjack as a team.

While teamplay is not technically illegal, casinos often refuse to pay out winnings to players who are found to have used it, claiming that they have violated the terms and conditions of their gaming agreement. In this case, the casino pointed to a clause in their agreement which stated that all bets were final and could not be disputed.

The Cardinals initially agreed to this, accepting that they would not be receiving their winnings. However, they quickly changed their mind after learning that the casino intended to keep the money anyway. They filed a lawsuit against the casino in order to recoup their lost winnings, and after a two-year legal battle, they have finally been victorious.

In his ruling, Judge James Marner sided with the Cardinals, stating that while teamplay may be frowned upon by casinos, it is not illegal. He went on to say that the players had not violated any of the terms or conditions of their agreement with the casino, and thus were legally entitled to receive their winnings.

This ruling is sure to set a precedent for future disputes between casinos and players who use teamplay tactics. It is also sure to be welcomed news for all those involved with the Arizona Cardinals football team, who can now finally put this long and costly legal battle behind them.
