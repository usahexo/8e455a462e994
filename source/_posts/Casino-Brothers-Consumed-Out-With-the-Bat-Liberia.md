Casino Brothers Consumed Out With the Bat Liberia

On the far side of Monrovia, down a rutted road and through some questionable neighborhoods, you will find Casino Beach. It's not really a beach, just a spot on the bank of the Saint Paul River where locals go to swim and kids go to play. On any given day, there are people fishing, washing clothes and gathering water from the river.

But on Sundays, Casino Beach is packed with people. DJ's set up sound systems on the sand and locals bring their grills and coolers for an all-day party. There's music and dancing and plenty of food and drink – much of it supplied by the Casino Brothers, who have been selling grilled chicken and beer here for as long as anyone can remember.

The Casino Brothers are Liberian-born entrepreneurs who got their start selling food on the streets of Monrovia in the 1980s. They were some of the first business owners in Liberia to use charcoal grills, which gave their food a distinctive flavor that quickly became popular with locals and expats alike. The brothers opened their first restaurant in 1990, shortly after Liberia's civil war began. They named it Casino Beach Grill, after the spot where they were doing most of their business.

The Grill was destroyed during the war, but the brothers rebuilt it after peace was restored in 1996. They've been at Casino Beach ever since, serving up their delicious grilled chicken to a loyal following. In addition to chicken, they also sell fish, rice and beans, plantains, hush puppies and cold drinks.

The Casino Brothers are a bit of an institution in Monrovia – so much so that they've even been featured on National Geographic TV. And while they may not be well-known outside of Liberia, they're definitely a favorite among locals and expats alike. If you're ever in Monrovia, be sure to stop by Casino Beach Grill – you won't regret it!

In what has become a typical night out for the duo, Joe and Mickey Pesci enjoy a few rounds of drinks at one of their favorite spots in Liberia. The friends have known each other since they were kids, and their close bond has only grown stronger over the years.

As they catch up on old times, they can't help but reflect on all that has transpired in their lives since they last saw each other. Joe has been busy scaling his business empire; in fact, he's just completed construction on his new casino resort in Monrovia. Mickey, meanwhile, has been focusing on his music career; he's been traveling all over the world performing at various venues.

Despite their successes, the two men can't help but feel a bit down. They've both experienced a lot of pain and loss in recent years and would give anything to go back to those simpler times. As they continue to reminisce, they become more and more intoxicated.

Eventually, they decide to call it a night and head home. On their way there, they get into a heated argument that quickly turns physical. They start brawling on the street, throwing punches and pulling hair until finally police arrive to break it up.

Both men are arrested and spend the night in jail. In the morning, they awaken with splitting headaches and realize just how foolish they were to let things get so out of hand. They apologize to each other for their behavior and resolve to never let anything come between them again.

This event serves as a reminder that even though life can be tough, it's important to make time for friends and family who matter most. Joe and Mickey Pesci may have had a rough night out, but at least they still have each other.
