#  What is Qatar?

Qatar is an Arab country that borders Saudi Arabia to the south and Iran to the north. The country occupies a peninsula on the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. It has a population of over 2.3 million people, making it the richest country in the world per capita.

Qatar has played an important role in international affairs, primarily through its support for terrorism and its close relationship with Saudi Arabia. Qatar's relationships with other countries in the region have also been strained at times.

The Qatar peninsula has been inhabited for centuries, first by nomadic Bedouin tribes and then by those who made it their home. Petroleum was discovered there in 1935, leading to rapid modernization and wealth for the small country. Qatar became an independent state in 1971, shortly after gaining its sovereignty from British control.

Since then, Qatar has worked to develop its economy and infrastructure. Its natural resources have helped fund major projects such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure improvements. Qataris enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world thanks to this wealth.

Qatar is also home to Al Jazeera Media Network, one of the largest news networks in the world. The network has been both praised and criticized for its reporting on global events.
