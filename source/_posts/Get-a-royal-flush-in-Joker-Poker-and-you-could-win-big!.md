#  Learn the basics of how to play Joker Poker 100 Hand Game

A game of Joker Poker 100 Hand is one where you are dealt 100 cards and must create the best five-card poker hand possible. The twist in this game is that there are two jokers in the deck, which can be used as any card you need to make your desired hand. In order to win this game, you’ll need to make the best five-card poker hand out of all 100 cards.

The game starts by dealing out 10 cards face down in a row in front of each player. The remaining 90 cards are placed in the middle of the table, face down. Players will then take turns flipping over cards from the middle of the table until they have matched either a pair or three-of-a-kind. Once a player has either matched a pair or three-of-a-kind, they will set those cards aside and continue flipping over cards from the middle of the table. When all players have either matched a pair or three-of-a-kind, or when there are no more cards left to flip over, the rest of the cards are turned over and players will compare hands.

The player with the best five-card poker hand out of all 100 cards wins the game. If there is a tie, then players will compare their second-best hands and so on until there is a clear winner.
