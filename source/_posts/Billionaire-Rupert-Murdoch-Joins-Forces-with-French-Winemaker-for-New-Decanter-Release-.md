#  Billionaire Rupert Murdoch Joins Forces with French Winemaker for New Decanter Release 

Rupert Murdoch, the billionaire media mogul and owner of 21st Century Fox, is expanding his wine business with a new decanter release. The Rupert Murdoch Limited Edition Decanter will be made in collaboration with renowned French winemaker Louis de Sacy.

This unique partnership was announced at an event at the Spotted Pig in New York City, where Murdoch and de Sacy unveiled their new creation. The Rupert Murdoch Limited EditionDecanter is a Bordeaux-style red wine that has been aged for 18 months in oak barrels. It will be available for purchase for $175 starting in late September.

Murdoch has been interested in wine for many years, and he has even built his own vineyard in California. His venture into winemaking began in 2001 with the purchase of Two Hands winery in Australia. He has since expanded his business to include properties in Chile, Argentina, and Italy.

De Sacy is no stranger to wine either; he has been making wine for over 40 years. He is the head of the family-owned winery Château de Sacy, which produces wine from grapes grown in the Bordeaux and Burgundy regions of France.

The two businessmen became friends several years ago after meeting at an event celebrating the 100th anniversary of Château Mouton Rothschild. Murdoch was so impressed with de Sacy's wines that he decided to partner with him on this new endeavor.

"Louis is a great friend, and I'm excited to work with him on this project," said Murdoch. "His wines are among the best in France, and I know people will love our new decanter."

De Sacy echoed these sentiments, stating, "I am very pleased to be working with Rupert on this project. His wines are some of the most respected in the world, and I'm sure people will enjoy our new collaboration."
