#  Revenue up for fire departments with video gambling machines 

A recent study shows that for fire departments with video gambling machines, revenue has increased. The study was conducted by the Illinois Policy Institute and it found that in the state of Illinois, local governments and fire departments received $286 million from video gambling in 2016. This is a drastic increase from the $43 million they received in 2009.

The increase in revenue can be partially attributed to the legalization of video gambling in 2009. Since then, the number of machines has quadrupled and they can now be found in nearly every town in Illinois. This proliferation of machines has led to an increase in addiction rates and crime.

Despite these negative consequences, many local governments continue to depend on video gambling revenue. In some cases, it accounts for up to half of the government’s budget. This is troubling because it means that taxpayers are being forced to subsidize an industry that causes harm to society as a whole.

It’s time for state and local governments to re-evaluate their relationships with the video gambling industry. The negative consequences far outweigh any benefits that may come from it.

#  Firefighters gear up for more money with new video gambling machines 

As the state of Illinois continues to face financial troubles, one group of state employees is looking to cash in with the installation of new video gambling machines.

Firefighters throughout the state have been pushing for the right to install video gambling machines in their firehouses, arguing that the extra revenue could help offset budget cuts and layoffs. The proposal has met with some resistance from lawmakers, who argue that the state should not be in the business of funding firehouses.

Now, firefighters are taking their case directly to the voters, with a new video detailing their argument for more money. The video, which was released last week, shows firefighters explaining how the new machines would benefit their departments.

"The money that these machines generate would allow us to maintain staffing levels and keep our stations open," said one firefighter in the video. "It would also allow us to purchase new equipment and upgrade our facilities."

So far, at least 15 towns across Illinois have approved plans to install video gambling machines in their firehouses. If approved by voters, each department could stand to make thousands of dollars in extra revenue each year.

#  Another municipality gets in on the action, adds video gambling machines to department 

The village of Addison is the latest municipality to allow video gambling machines in its public places.

This move comes as a bit of a surprise, as the village banned video gambling back in 2013. It seems that officials have had a change of heart, and are now allowing the machines in the police department, public library, and municipal building.

Village President Rich Veenstra says that the decision was made in order to help supplement the budget. He estimates that the village will bring in around $30,000 per year from the machines.

This isn’t the first time that video gambling has been allowed in Addison – back in 2009 and 2010, there were machines in local bars. However, those were eventually shut down due to complaints from residents about problem gambling.

It will be interesting to see how things play out this time around. Some residents are already speaking out against the move, while others seem to be okay with it. Only time will tell if this decision ends up being a wise one or not.

#  Department hopes to make money off of video gambling machines 

The Department of Revenue is looking to install video gambling machines in local establishments in order to make some extra money.

The proposal would allow for five machines per business, with a tax rate of 25 percent on the profits from the machines. The hope is to bring in an additional $2 million in revenue for the state.

Critics of the proposal say that it will lead to more gambling addiction, while supporters say that it will be a way for people to relax and have some fun.

No decisions have been made yet on whether or not the proposal will move forward.

#  Money pouring in for departments with new video gambling machines

In the state of ____, lawmakers have eagerly ushered in a new era of video gambling machines in an attempt to bolster finances for various government departments. The rollout has been a smashing success by all accounts, with money pouring into state coffers from the new gaming machines.

In the city of ____, for instance, the police department has seen its budget increase by over 25% thanks to profits generated from the new video gambling machines. In addition, courthouse funding has also seen a significant bump thanks to the added revenue from video poker and slots.

Not everyone is happy with the proliferation of the new machines, however. Some watchdog groups worry that addiction rates will skyrocket as people lose more and more money. Others are concerned that minors will be able to access the games more easily than before.

Regardless of these concerns, it seems clear that video gambling is here to stay – and state governments across the country are taking note.
