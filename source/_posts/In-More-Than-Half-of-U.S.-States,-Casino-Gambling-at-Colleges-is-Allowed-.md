#  Is Casino Gambling Legal on College Campuses? It Depends on the State 

College students always enjoy a good game of casino gambling. But is it legal on college campuses? It depends on the state. In some states, casino gambling is completely illegal for anyone, including college students. But in other states, casino gambling may be allowed on college campuses with some restrictions.

In most cases, casino gambling is only allowed in certain areas on campus, such as a specific building or room. And usually only people over 21 years old are allowed to participate in casino gambling. Some states have more relaxed laws and allow casino gambling at any age, but there may still be age restrictions on which games can be played.

There are also different laws governing how much money students can gamble. In some states, there is no limit on the amount of money that can be wagered. But in other states, there may be a limit on how much money students can wager each day or each week.

It’s important to check the specific laws in your state before playing any casino games on campus. If you’re not sure what the law says, ask a campus police officer or your school’s administration. They will be able to tell you what is and isn’t allowed on campus.

#  Casino Gambling is Legal on 18 U.S. College Campuses

Casino gambling is legal on 18 U.S. college campuses as of September 2018, according to the Student Gambling
Concern organization. The student organization, which conducted a survey of 326 colleges and universities, found that
187 schools allow some form of casino gambling on campus. This number is up from 174 in 2017 and 127 in 2016.

The study also found that 97 percent of schools that allow casino gambling on campus have a student population over 10,000. Additionally, 63 percent of schools with casino gambling have a population of 20,000 or more students. Only 26 schools had populations under 5,000 students.

The Student Gambling Concern organization says the increase in casino gambling on campus is due to the legalization of sports betting in May 2018. “Colleges and universities are looking for ways to generate revenue, and casino gambling is seen as an easy way to do that,” says SGCC spokesperson Chris Cangelosi.

While many students enjoy the opportunity to gamble on campus, there are also concerns about its effects on academic performance and mental health. Studies have shown that pathological gambling can lead to anxiety, depression, and even suicide ideation.
