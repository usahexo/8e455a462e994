But a new method has surfaced that makes unlocking these games easy!

Here's how to do it:

First, find the game you want to unlock. In this example, we'll use Football Coach.

Next, locate the file called "config.lua" in the game's directory. This file contains all of the game's settings.

Open the file in a text editor (we recommend Notepad++), and look for the line that says "CASINO_NAME = nil". Change "nil" to "footballcoach", making sure to keep the quotes in place.

Save the file and launch the game. You should now have access to the full version of Football Coach!

Congratulations - you've just unlocked a free slot machine!

Points are scored by either landing on an opponent’s square or completing one of your squares first. There are also bonus squares which offer extra points or other bonuses such as speed boosts or extra time. Be sure to use them wisely as they can help you take the lead!

The game ends when either time expires or one player has reached 100 points – whichever happens first. At that point, the player with the most points is declared the winner!
