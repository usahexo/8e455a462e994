            <h1 id="Blackjack-Dealer-Gets-Sued-For-Not-Shuffling-Guinea"><a href="#Blackjack-Dealer-Gets-Sued-For-Not-Shuffling-Guinea" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack Dealer Gets Sued For Not Shuffling Guinea"></a>Blackjack Dealer Gets Sued For Not Shuffling Guinea</h1><p>Blackjack dealers in Las Vegas are used to dealing with all sorts of wacky requests from their players, but one dealer found herself on the wrong end of a lawsuit last week for not shuffling a guinea.</p>
<p>The incident occurred at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino when 62-year-old John Francis D’Angelo requested that the dealer shuffle his guinea, which he had just purchased from the casino’s gift shop. The dealer refused, stating that she did not know how to shuffle a guinea, and an argument ensued.</p>
<p>D’Angelo later filed a lawsuit against the casino, claiming that he was denied his right to a fair game. He is seeking damages in excess of $10,000.</p>
<p>Casino officials responded to the lawsuit by stating that they do not provide dealers with instruction on how to shuffle any type of foreign currency, and that it is up to the customer to learn how to handle such items before playing games of chance.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that a casino has been sued over an unusual request by a player. In 2010, a man in Missouri sued Harrah’s Casino over allegations that they refused to let him play blackjack using his stockpile of Confederate coins.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Fined-For-NOT-Shuffling-Guinea"><a href="#Casino-Fined-For-NOT-Shuffling-Guinea" class="headerlink" title="Casino Fined For NOT Shuffling Guinea"></a>Casino Fined For NOT Shuffling Guinea</h1><p>A casino in Las Vegas has been fined by the Nevada Gaming Control Board for not shuffling a deck of cards that had been used in a game of blackjack. </p>
<p>The incident took place on September 15, when a player at the table alerted the dealer that there appeared to be something wrong with the deck. The dealer notified casino security, who then confiscated the cards and called in the state gaming control board. </p>
<p>An investigation revealed that someone had apparently switched out two decks of cards – one with regular faces, and one with all queens of spades – without the casino staff noticing. The board ruled that the casino was at fault for not properly shuffling the cards and fined it $5,000. </p>
<p>This is not the first time that a casino has been fined for mishandling a deck of cards. In 2010, another Las Vegas casino was fined for using cards that had not been properly shuffled, and in 2012 a different casino was penalized for using cards that had been marked by a player.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-Dealer-Could-Go-to-Jail-for-Not-Shuffling-Guinea"><a href="#Blackjack-Dealer-Could-Go-to-Jail-for-Not-Shuffling-Guinea" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack Dealer Could Go to Jail for Not Shuffling Guinea"></a>Blackjack Dealer Could Go to Jail for Not Shuffling Guinea</h1><p>Las Vegas, NV – A blackjack dealer is in trouble with the law after being caught not shuffling a deck of guinea. The incident occurred at the MGM Grand casino, where surveillance footage allegedly shows the dealer failing to mix up the cards properly.</p>
<p>If convicted, the dealer could face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. Officials are still investigating whether any other players were affected by the unshuffled cards.</p>
<p>In a statement, a spokesperson for MGM Grand said: “MGM Grand takes its gaming regulations very seriously, and we will cooperate fully with the authorities on this matter.”</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a casino has had to deal with an issue involving unshuffled guinea. In 2013, a player at the Venetian las Vegas won nearly $50,000 after being dealt four consecutive blackjacks. It turns out that the dealer had failed to mix up the cards properly, resulting in an unfair advantage for the player.</p>
<p>Casinos have long been struggling to keep up with new technologies that allow players to cheat dealers. In recent years, there has been a surge in popularity of apps like Ace Trainer Pro, which allow players to track card values and make better decisions while playing blackjack.</p>
<h1 id="Woman-Wins-Lawsuit-After-Casino-Doesn’t-Shuffle-Guinea"><a href="#Woman-Wins-Lawsuit-After-Casino-Doesn’t-Shuffle-Guinea" class="headerlink" title="Woman Wins Lawsuit After Casino Doesn’t Shuffle Guinea"></a>Woman Wins Lawsuit After Casino Doesn’t Shuffle Guinea</h1><p>A woman in Reno, Nevada, has won a lawsuit after the casino refused to shuffle her guinea pig. </p>
<p>According to the woman, she and her guinea pig, Simon, were playing poker at the casino when a dealer refused to shuffle Simon’s deck of cards. “I couldn’t believe it,” said the woman. “My guinea pig is a very good poker player.” </p>
<p>The casino defended its decision not to shuffle Simon’s cards, saying that it was against their policy to shuffle animals’ cards. “We simply don’t have the staff to do that,” said a casino spokesperson. </p>
<p>The woman disagreed, arguing that if casinos can shuffle human cards, they can surely shuffle animal cards as well. </p>
<p>Ultimately, the court sided with the woman and awarded her $1,000 in damages. “This is a victory for all animals,” said the woman.</p>
<h1 id="Court-Ruling-Casino-Must-Shuffle-Guinea-Before-Every-Hand"><a href="#Court-Ruling-Casino-Must-Shuffle-Guinea-Before-Every-Hand" class="headerlink" title="Court Ruling: Casino Must Shuffle Guinea Before Every Hand"></a>Court Ruling: Casino Must Shuffle Guinea Before Every Hand</h1><p>In a landmark court ruling, a district judge ordered a casino to shuffle Guinea before every hand in order to ensure fairness.</p>
<p>The casino, which had been using the same deck of cards for months without shuffling, was found to be in violation of state regulations.</p>
<p>“The casino must ensure that each and every hand is fair,” the judge ruled. “This means that Guinea must be shuffled before every hand.”</p>
<p>Casino officials said they would comply with the order, but they expressed concern that it would slow down the game and increase wait times for players.</p>
<p>“We understand the importance of ensuring fairness, but we also need to keep things moving at a reasonable pace,” one official said.</p>
<p>But the judge said that was not a concern.</p>
<p>“The casino can still offer a fast-paced game if it chooses,” he said. “But it must also shuffle Guinea before each hand. This is non-negotiable.”</p>
