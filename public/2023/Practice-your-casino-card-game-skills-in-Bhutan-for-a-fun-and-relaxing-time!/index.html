Check out Bhutan!"></a>Who knew that casino card gaming could be so much fun? Check out Bhutan!</h1><p>The Himalayas create a stunning backdrop for the country of Bhutan. This tiny landlocked country is bordered by China and India. The culture in Bhutan is unique, and the landscape is breathtaking. If you are looking for an adventure, consider traveling to Bhutan to experience all that it has to offer.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to experience Bhutan is by playing some of the card games offered in the casinos. While there are many casino games to choose from, card games are a favorite among tourists and locals alike. If you have never played casino card games before, don’t worry. We will teach you how to play three of the most popular games offered in Bhutan casinos.</p>
<p>First up is blackjack. This game is played with between one and eight decks of cards. The object of blackjack is to draw cards totaling 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player’s opponent, known as the dealer, deals two cards face up to each player and two cards face down to themselves. One of the dealer’s cards is turned over so that both players can see it. The players then take turns trying to beat the dealer’s hand by either drawing additional cards (up to five) or standing with their current total (a hand value of 17 or above is considered a stand). A hand value of 21 consisting of an ace and a ten-value card is called a blackjack and pays out 3:2 on your bet.</p>
<p>If you would like to try your hand at poker, we recommend playing Texas hold’em. This game is played with two cards down (hole cards) and five community cards that are dealt face up in the middle of the table. Players use two hole cards and any combination of five community cards to make the best possible five-card poker hand. Betting rounds take place before any community cards are revealed and after each community card is revealed. The player with the best five-card poker hand at the end wins the pot.</p>
<p>Last up is baccarat. This game is often considered a high roller game because it has relatively high betting limits. In baccarat, players are dealt two cards face up and one card face down (the banker’s second card). The goal of baccarat is to draw a hand totaling nine or as close to nine as possible without going over (value 10 equals 0 points). After all three player hands have been created, the banker’s hand gets revealed and points are tallied up just like regular poker hands - except that only totals of nine or less count towards victory here! Whichever player has the highest point total at the end wins!</p>
