The Rupert Murdoch Limited Edition Decanter will be made in collaboration with renowned French winemaker Louis de Sacy.</p>
<p>This unique partnership was announced at an event at the Spotted Pig in New York City, where Murdoch and de Sacy unveiled their new creation. The Rupert Murdoch Limited EditionDecanter is a Bordeaux-style red wine that has been aged for 18 months in oak barrels. It will be available for purchase for $175 starting in late September.</p>
<p>Murdoch has been interested in wine for many years, and he has even built his own vineyard in California. His venture into winemaking began in 2001 with the purchase of Two Hands winery in Australia. He has since expanded his business to include properties in Chile, Argentina, and Italy.</p>
<p>De Sacy is no stranger to wine either; he has been making wine for over 40 years. He is the head of the family-owned winery Château de Sacy, which produces wine from grapes grown in the Bordeaux and Burgundy regions of France.</p>
<p>The two businessmen became friends several years ago after meeting at an event celebrating the 100th anniversary of Château Mouton Rothschild. Murdoch was so impressed with de Sacy’s wines that he decided to partner with him on this new endeavor.</p>
<p>“Louis is a great friend, and I’m excited to work with him on this project,” said Murdoch. “His wines are among the best in France, and I know people will love our new decanter.”</p>
<p>De Sacy echoed these sentiments, stating, “I am very pleased to be working with Rupert on this project. His wines are some of the most respected in the world, and I’m sure people will enjoy our new collaboration.”</p>
<h1 id="Rupert-Murdoch-Signs-Historic-Agreement-with-French-Winemaker-for-New-Decanter-Design"><a href="#Rupert-Murdoch-Signs-Historic-Agreement-with-French-Winemaker-for-New-Decanter-Design" class="headerlink" title="Rupert Murdoch Signs Historic Agreement with French Winemaker for New Decanter Design"></a>Rupert Murdoch Signs Historic Agreement with French Winemaker for New Decanter Design</h1><p>Rupert Murdoch, owner of the prominent Fox News network and 21st Century Fox media conglomerate, has agreed to produce a new design for wine decanters in partnership with a prominent French winemaker. The two companies are expected to unveil the new design at a joint press conference in Paris on Tuesday.</p>
<p>This is a landmark agreement for both parties involved. Murdoch’s Fox News network is one of the most-watched cable news channels in the world, while the winemaker is one of France’s most respected brands.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the deal, the new decanter design will be made from glass and will feature a distinctive shape that sets it apart from other wine decanters on the market. It is also expected to be decorated with elegant etchings that give it a sophisticated look.</p>
<p>Murdoch hailed the agreement as “a major coup for both our companies.” In remarks made to reporters, he said that he was confident that the new decanter would be a big hit with consumers and that it would help further strengthen his company’s position in the global wine market.</p>
<p>The winemaker, meanwhile, praised Murdoch’s “track record of innovation and success” and said that it was confident that the two companies could work together to create a winning product.</p>
<p>The new decanter is set to hit store shelves later this year.</p>
<h1 id="Global-Media-Mogul-Rupert-Murdoch-Teams-Up-with-Renowned-French-Winemaker-for-New-Decanter-Project"><a href="#Global-Media-Mogul-Rupert-Murdoch-Teams-Up-with-Renowned-French-Winemaker-for-New-Decanter-Project" class="headerlink" title="Global Media Mogul Rupert Murdoch Teams Up with Renowned French Winemaker for New Decanter Project"></a>Global Media Mogul Rupert Murdoch Teams Up with Renowned French Winemaker for New Decanter Project</h1><p>LOS ANGELES, CA - Global media mogul Rupert Murdoch has announced a new project in collaboration with renowned French winemaker Jean-Claude Boisset. The two have teamed up to create the Rupert Murdoch Decanter, a limited edition wine vessel designed to age and enhance the flavor of red wine.</p>
<p>“Jean-Claude and I have been discussing this project for some time now,” said Murdoch. “We share a passion for wine, and we’re both committed to making the Rupert Murdoch Decanter the very best it can be.”</p>
<p>The decanter is made from lead-free crystal and will be available in two sizes: a 750 ml bottle that will retail for $120, and a 1.5 liter magnum that will sell for $200. Both versions will come with a handcrafted sterling silver stopper.</p>
<p>“The crystal is flawless and the sterling silver is of the highest quality,” said Boisset. “I’m confident that this decanter will be appreciated by wine lovers around the world.”</p>
<p>Murdoch added, “This is an exciting new venture for us, and we’re looking forward to seeing the Rupert Murdoch Decanter take its place among the finest wine accessories on the market.”</p>
<h1 id="Rupert-Murdoch-and-French-Winemaker-to-Release-Joint-Decanter-Design"><a href="#Rupert-Murdoch-and-French-Winemaker-to-Release-Joint-Decanter-Design" class="headerlink" title="Rupert Murdoch and French Winemaker to Release Joint Decanter Design"></a>Rupert Murdoch and French Winemaker to Release Joint Decanter Design</h1><p>Rupert Murdoch, the renown Australian-American media mogul, has partnered with a French winemaker to produce a new wine decanter. The decanter, which is made of crystal, will be released in time for the holiday season. </p>
<p>“I have been interested in wine for many years,” said Murdoch in a press release. “ partnering with a renowned winemaker was the perfect way to produce a world-class decanter.” </p>
<p>The decanter has been designed by Vincent Chollet, the head of design at the renowned French winery Louis Jadot. The goal was to create a decanter that would both look and perform well. Chollet achieved this by creating a tapered design that allows for air flow and increases the surface area of the wine as it interact with the crystals. </p>
<p>“We are incredibly proud of this collaboration,” said Chollet. “Our team has worked tirelessly to create a product that both Rupert and I can stand behind.” </p>
<p>The Rupert Murdoch and French Winemaker Decanter is available now through select retailers.</p>

<p>Murdoch, who owns several vineyards in France and elsewhere, said he was approached by a number of different companies about developing a new decanter design but chose to team up with the French firm because of its “innovative approach”.</p>
<p>The new decanter, which will be made from lead-free crystal, is designed to let wine breathe more easily and will be released later this year.</p>
<p>“This is an important step forward for the wine industry,” Murdoch said. “Too often wine is left to breathe in a decanter that’s not designed for that purpose. This can lead to oxidation and a loss of flavor. Our new design solves that problem.”</p>
<p>Murdoch added that he was confident the new decanter would be a hit with consumers around the world.</p>
<p>“I’ve tasted some of the prototypes and they’re really amazing,” he said. “I think people are going to love them.”</p>
