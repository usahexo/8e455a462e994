This is a victory for taxpayers in the region, as it means that they will have more money available to them after they have paid their taxes.</p>
<p>The ruling overturned a previous decision by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) which said that gambling losses could be deducted from taxable income. The IRS argued that gambling losses were a form of business expenses, but the Skagit County Superior Court ruled that they were not.</p>
<p>This is good news for taxpayers in the Skagit region, who will now be able to keep more of their money after paying taxes. It is also good news for the local economy, as it will mean that taxpayers will have more money to spend on goods and services.</p>
<h1 id="SKagit-Region-Bingo-Players-Keep-Money-In-Their-Pockets-As-Gambling-Losses-Aren’t-Applied-To-Disposable-Income"><a href="#SKagit-Region-Bingo-Players-Keep-Money-In-Their-Pockets-As-Gambling-Losses-Aren’t-Applied-To-Disposable-Income" class="headerlink" title="SKagit Region Bingo Players Keep Money In Their Pockets As Gambling Losses Aren’t Applied To Disposable Income"></a>SKagit Region Bingo Players Keep Money In Their Pockets As Gambling Losses Aren’t Applied To Disposable Income</h1><p>In Skagit County, Washington, SKagit Bingo players don’t have to worry about their gambling losses counting against their disposable income. This is thanks to a state law that excludes bingo halls from the list of places where gambling losses are applied towards one’s disposable income.</p>
<p>This means that while casino and racetrack gamblers in the state may have to subtract their gambling losses from their disposable income when filing their taxes, SKagit Bingo players don’t have to. And since there are three bingo halls in the Skagit region, this has been good news for local bingo players, who can now keep more of their money in their pockets.</p>
<p>According to Patsy Byers-Larson, who has been playing bingo at the Mt. Vernon Elks Lodge for over 30 years, the exclusion of bingo halls from the list of places where gambling losses are applied has been a big help to local players. “It’s a good thing,” she said. “I like to play bingo, and it’s nice not to have my gambling losses count against my disposable income.”</p>
<p>Others in the region echo Larson’s sentiment. Brenda Swanson, who plays bingo at the Burlington Eagles Club three times a week, says that being able to exclude her bingo losses from her disposable income has saved her a lot of money. “I’ve probably saved $100 or $200 overall since I started playing here,” she said. “That definitely helps out.”</p>
<p>While some may see this as unfair advantage for SKagit Bingo players, local officials say that it’s simply good public policy. “This is just common sense,” said Penny Gardner, administrator for the Washington State Gambling Commission. “If somebody is going to gamble, we want them to do it in a place where they’re not going to lose too much money.”</p>
<h1 id="Washington-State-Bingo-Lovers-rejoice-as-gambling-losses-aren’t-deducted-from-disposable-income"><a href="#Washington-State-Bingo-Lovers-rejoice-as-gambling-losses-aren’t-deducted-from-disposable-income" class="headerlink" title="Washington State Bingo Lovers rejoice as gambling losses aren’t deducted from disposable income"></a>Washington State Bingo Lovers rejoice as gambling losses aren’t deducted from disposable income</h1><p>In Washington State, bingo players no longer have to worry about how much they spend on their hobby. Gambling losses are no longer deducted from disposable income, meaning that players can now enjoy their favorite pastime without having to worry about financial repercussions.</p>
<p>This news is sure to be welcomed by all Washington State bingo lovers. In the past, players were often forced to cut back on their spending because they didn’t want their losses to impact their disposable income. Now, they can play without any financial stress.</p>
<p>This change was made possible by the passage of Senate Bill 6636. This bill was authored by Senator Doug Ericksen and it received overwhelming support from both Republicans and Democrats. In a statement, Senator Ericksen said that this bill is “a great victory for Washingtonians who love playing bingo.”</p>
<p>He went on to say that the passage of this bill will help create jobs and boost the economy. He also said that it will make it easier for people to enjoy their hobbies without having to worry about money.</p>
<p>Washington State bingo lovers are sure to appreciate this change in the law. It’s a big win for everyone who enjoys playing this popular game.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-losses-won’t-be-deducted-from-your-disposable-income-in-Skagit-region"><a href="#Gambling-losses-won’t-be-deducted-from-your-disposable-income-in-Skagit-region" class="headerlink" title="Gambling losses won’t be deducted from your disposable income in Skagit region"></a>Gambling losses won’t be deducted from your disposable income in Skagit region</h1><p>In late March, the Skagit County Board of Commissioners passed an ordinance that prevents people from deducting gambling losses from their taxable income. The new rule is an amendment to the county’s code of ordinances and it went into effect on April 1.</p>
<p>The amendment was proposed by Commissioner Mike Anderson and it was supported by the Skagit County Treasurer’s Office. Anderson said that the ordinance will help the county collect more taxes from people who gamble.</p>
<p>Under the old rules, people could deduct their losses from their taxable income, which often resulted in them paying less taxes. This new amendment will prevent people from doing that and it is expected to bring in an additional $100,000 in tax revenue for the county each year.</p>
<p>Commissioner Anderson said that the amendment was not meant to punish people who gamble, but rather to make sure that everyone pays their fair share of taxes. He also said that he does not believe that gambling is a sin and he does not have a problem with people who gamble as long as they are responsible and pay their taxes.</p>
<h1 id="Skagit-regional-taxpayers-can-now-deduct-their-gambling-losses-without-affecting-their-disposable-income"><a href="#Skagit-regional-taxpayers-can-now-deduct-their-gambling-losses-without-affecting-their-disposable-income" class="headerlink" title="Skagit regional taxpayers can now deduct their gambling losses without affecting their disposable income"></a>Skagit regional taxpayers can now deduct their gambling losses without affecting their disposable income</h1><p>The Skagit Regional Taxpayers Association has announced that taxpayers in the region will now be able to deduct their gambling losses from their taxable income, without it impacting their disposable income.</p>
<p>This change follows the recent introduction of new tax laws in the United States, which allow taxpayers to deduct their gambling losses as a part of their overall deductions. The SRA has confirmed that this change will apply to all taxpayers in the Skagit region, including those who live in the neighbouring county of Whatcom.</p>
<p>Gambling losses can be deducted from any type of gambling, including casino games, sports betting, and lotteries. However, players are only allowed to deduct up to the amount they have won from gambling. For example, if someone has lost $1,000 at the casino but has only won $500, they can only deduct $500 worth of losses from their taxable income.</p>
<p>Chuck Baumann, spokesperson for the SRA, commented on the news: “We’re really pleased that we can offer this deduction to our taxpayers. Gambling can be a fun way to spend your time, but it’s important that you’re aware of the tax implications. This change means that people can enjoy themselves without having to worry about how it will impact their taxes.”</p>
