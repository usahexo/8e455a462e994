            <h1 id="Congress-Considers-Taxing-Internet-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Congress-Considers-Taxing-Internet-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Congress Considers Taxing Internet Gambling Winnings"></a>Congress Considers Taxing Internet Gambling Winnings</h1><p>The federal government is considering imposing taxes on Americans who win money from gambling over the internet. The proposed bill, called the “Internet Gambling Regulation, Consumer Protection, and Enforcement Act”, was introduced by Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California.</p>
<p>Under the proposed bill, players would be taxed at a rate of 25% on all winnings over $10,000. This would include lottery winnings, casino games, and sports betting. The bill also calls for a new licensing process for operators of internet gambling sites.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it is needed to protect consumers and prevent crime. Critics argue that the bill amounts to a new tax on the poor and working class. They also argue that it will do nothing to prevent crime or protect consumers.</p>
<p>A similar bill was introduced in Congress in 2006, but it did not pass.</p>
<h1 id="IRS-Issues-Guidance-on-Taxation-of-Online-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#IRS-Issues-Guidance-on-Taxation-of-Online-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="IRS Issues Guidance on Taxation of Online Gambling Winnings"></a>IRS Issues Guidance on Taxation of Online Gambling Winnings</h1><p>On July 26, 2019, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued Notice 2019-48 (the “Notice”), providing guidance on the federal income tax treatment of gambling winnings from online casinos and other forms of internet gambling.</p>
<p>Generally, gambling winnings are subject to federal income tax. However, there are a number of exceptions, including winnings from lotteries and bingo, which are nontaxable. The Notice provides that gambling winnings from internet casinos will be treated in the same manner as bingo and lottery winnings for federal income tax purposes. This means that they will be exempt from federal income tax if they are incidental to the primary purpose of engaging in a hobby or recreational activity.</p>
<p>The Notice also provides that taxpayers who gamble at internet casinos can take a deduction for any losses they incur up to the amount of their winnings. This is similar to the deduction available for losses incurred when gambling at traditional casinos.</p>
<p>The IRS issued this guidance in response to a growing number of Americans who are using online casinos to gamble. The Notice is intended to provide clarity on how these winnings should be taxed and help taxpayers understand their tax obligations with respect to online gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Are-Your-Gambling-Winnings-Taxable"><a href="#Are-Your-Gambling-Winnings-Taxable" class="headerlink" title="Are Your Gambling Winnings Taxable?"></a>Are Your Gambling Winnings Taxable?</h1><p>As with any money earned, gambling winnings are subject to income tax. However, unlike most other types of income, there are a few exceptions to the rule.</p>
<p>Gambling winnings are considered taxable income in the year they are earned. This means that if you hit a jackpot at a casino in December but don’t cash out until January, you will owe taxes on the winnings for the year 2018.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are a few exceptions to the rule. Gambling losses can be used to offset gambling winnings, and certain gambling-related expenses may also be deducted. For example, casino trip expenses and betting losses can be written off on your tax return.</p>
<p>What if I Lose Money Betting?</p>
<p>Losing money while gambling does not affect your taxable income. In fact, you can’t deduct your gambling losses from your taxable income. However, you can still use them to offset any gambling winnings you may have.</p>
<h1 id="State-Levies-Taxes-on-Poker-and-Casino-Winnings"><a href="#State-Levies-Taxes-on-Poker-and-Casino-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="State Levies Taxes on Poker and Casino Winnings"></a>State Levies Taxes on Poker and Casino Winnings</h1><p>A state can levy a tax on the winnings of a poker or casino game. The state may tax all winnings, or it may only tax winnings in excess of some threshold amount. For example, a state may levy a 10% tax on all poker and casino winnings over $1,000.</p>
<p>The rationale for taxing poker and casino winnings is that the winnings are income to the player and, as such, should be subject to taxation. The amount of the tax will depend on the state’s tax rates, but will generally be in the range of 10% to 35%.</p>
<p>The tax applies to both professional and amateur players. In addition, the tax applies regardless of whether the player won or lost money playing poker or casino games.</p>
<p>Taxpayers are generally required to report their poker and casino winnings on their income tax returns. They must also pay any applicable taxes on those winnings.</p>
<p>Some taxpayers may be able to claim a deduction for gambling losses incurred in connection with their poker or casino activities. However, the amount of the deduction will generally be limited to the amount of gambling income reported on the taxpayer’s return.</p>
<h1 id="What-Are-the-Taxes-on-Gambling-Winnings-in-Canada"><a href="#What-Are-the-Taxes-on-Gambling-Winnings-in-Canada" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Taxes on Gambling Winnings in Canada?"></a>What Are the Taxes on Gambling Winnings in Canada?</h1><p>The taxes you pay on gambling winnings in Canada depend on the type of gambling and where you are located. Here’s an overview of the tax rates for different types of gambling and betting in Canada.</p>
<p>Added Winnings</p>
<p>If you receive any winnings on top of your original stakes, these are taxed as income. The amount you pay in income tax depends on how much you win. For example, if you win $1,000 on top of your original $100 stake, you will pay tax on the full $1,100. The tax rate for added winnings is usually between 25% and 45%.</p>
<p>Casino Winnings</p>
<p>If you win money from playing casino games, the amount you win is considered taxable income. The tax rate for casino winnings is usually between 25% and 45%. However, some provinces have higher rates: Quebec has a 52% tax rate for casino winnings, and Manitoba has a 57% rate.</p>
<p>Lottery Winnings</p>
<p>Lottery winnings are taxable at the federal level and the provincial level. The federal government charges a flat withholding tax of 31%, while the provincial government may charge an additional 10% or more. So, if you win a jackpot worth $1 million in Ontario, for example, you would pay around $343,000 in taxes (31% federal withholding tax + 10% provincial withholding tax).</p>
<p>Racing Prizes</p>
<p>Prizes awarded for winning a horse race or other race are taxable as income. The applicable tax rate will vary depending on the province where the race took place. For example, in Ontario the rate is 33%, while in British Columbia it is 6%.</p>
