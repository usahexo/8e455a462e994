That’s a lot of possibilities, and it can be tough to remember them all. But don’t worry, we’re here to help.</p>
<p>We’ll start with the best possible hand and work our way down to the worst. The Royal Flush is the best possible hand, and it’s made up of an Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and 10 all of the same suit. Next is the Straight Flush, which is made up of five consecutive cards of the same suit. After that is four of a kind, followed by a full house. Then comes three of a kind, two pair, one pair, and finally, high card.</p>
<p>A Royal Flush is worth 1,600 points in most variants of poker. A Straight Flush is worth 400 points. Four of a kind is worth 200 points. A full house is worth 100 points. Three of a kind is worth 30 points. Two pair is worth 20 points. One pair is worth 10 points and high card is worth nothing.</p>
<p>Now that you know the rankings of the hands, let’s take a look at some examples. Here’s a list of some possible poker hands:</p>
<p>Royal Flush: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten<br>Straight Flush: Two through Ten (all clubs)<br>Four of a Kind: Two Aces<br>Full House: King over Jack (spades), Ten over Nine (hearts), eight over seven (clubs)<br>Flush: Six hearts<br>Straight: Five clubs<br>Three of a Kind: Three eights<br>Two Pair: Aces over tens</p>
<h1 id="How-Many-Possible-Poker-Hands-are-There-When-Dealing-5-Cards-from-a-Deck-of-52"><a href="#How-Many-Possible-Poker-Hands-are-There-When-Dealing-5-Cards-from-a-Deck-of-52" class="headerlink" title="How Many Possible Poker Hands are There When Dealing 5 Cards from a Deck of 52?"></a>How Many Possible Poker Hands are There When Dealing 5 Cards from a Deck of 52?</h1><p>The answer to this question is, of course, 52C5 or 2,598,960 possible poker hands. However, this number can be drastically reduced if we take into consideration the fact that some hands are more likely to occur than others. For example, a royal flush (A, K, Q, J, 10 of the same suit) is statistically more rare than a pair of twos.</p>
<p>There are six different ways to make a royal flush and therefore just 4, Kens (6C5), Queens (6C4), Jacks (6C3), and Tens (6C2) when dealing five cards from a deck of 52. This leaves us with 2,594,940 possible poker hands.</p>
<p>This number can be further reduced if we take into account the fact that some suits are more common than others. For example, there are only four spades in a deck of 52 cards whereas there are six clubs. This means that a club flush is more likely than a spade flush and so on.</p>
<p>Using this information, we can come up with the following probabilities for various types of poker hands:</p>
<p>~ Pair – 1 in 3<br>~ Two pair – 1 in 6<br>~ Three of a kind – 1 in 24<br>~ Straight – 1 in 30<br>~ Flush – 1 in 37<br>~ Full house – 1 in 72<br>~ Four of a kind – 1 in 792<br>~ Straight flush – 1 in 40’832</p>

This calculation does not take into account the order of the hands.</p>
<p>There are 4 suits in a deck of cards: clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades. Within each suit, there are 13 unique cards: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 10 Jack (J), Queen (Q), King (K).</p>
<p>There are 2 different types of cards: face cards (Jack (J), Queen (Q), King (K)) and non-face cards (Ace, 2,…10).</p>
<p>With these 26 unique cards available for five-card hands there are 26x25x24x23x22 or 1,326 possible poker hands.</p>

Here is a breakdown of the different types of hands and the probability of each:</p>
<p>One pair - 732,560 (28.27%)<br>Two pair - 253,440 (9.87%)<br>Three of a kind - 81,920 (3.21%)<br>Straight - 54,000 (2.09%)<br>Flush - 36, 720 (1.42%)<br>Full House - 16,200 (0.63%)<br>Four of a kind - 3,584 (0.14%)<br>Straight flush - 1,644 (.06%)<br>Royal flush - 312 (.012%)</p>
